A simple implementation of a ray-tracer in Matlab using its object-oriented support. For this ray-tracer I want to support:
- Point light sources (done)
- Planes as geometric primitive (done)
- Texture mapping (done)
- Anti-aliasing (done)
- Phong's light model (done)
- Added spherical camera model (done)
- Quadtree for the acceleration of the ray-tracing (TODO)
- Movement of the camera (done)
- Movement of the scene or objects in the scene (TODO)
